\begin{itemize}
    \item $A[X]$ with a capital letter indicates a set of variables, e.g.
          $X=\{x_1,\dots, x_n\}$.
    \item $\pi$, unless otherwise defined, refers to some kind of
          projection, usually the projection onto the quotient. $\pi_1$
          with no definition is projection onto the first component of the product.
    \item $\p$ is always a prime ideal unless otherwise noted.
    \item $I, J$ are always ideals unless otherwise noted.
    \item $(S)$ refers to the ideal generated by $S$
          unless it is being used as grouping.
    \item $I^{\text{e}}_{\phi}=(\phi(I))$. $\phi$ may be omitted when it can be
          inferred from context.
    \item $\overline{X}$ where $X$ is a set denotes the
          complement of $X$. $X^{\text{C}}$ denotes the
          closure of $X$ in its containing space.
